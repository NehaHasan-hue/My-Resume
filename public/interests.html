        <h1>NEHA HASAN's Interests</h1>
                <p>Though I am not super skilled at a single thing, I do love to do a lot of things.
                Trying things out and being stuck with them inspite of failing is one of my key traits
                </p> <hr />
            <h2>Some of My Favorite Hobbies are as follows</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
                    <img src="" height="200">
                        <p>I love playing both Acoustic and Electic guitar along with keyboard and occasionally a drum set. 
                        Though I am not a professional, I can strum almost any chord on both types of guitars </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Playing Chess</h3>
                    <img src="" height="200">
                        <p>I havve been playing chess casually for about two years now. I mostly play online but i do love to
                            play over the board games with others. My elo in both rapid(10 to 25 mins games) and blitz 
                            (3 to 5 mins games) has supressed the 900 benchmark. Do challenge me on my 
                            <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a> profile by clicking the image above. I always

                <li><h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
                    <img src="" height="200">
                    <p>From Role Playing RPG games like Mass Effect trilogy to Vast Open world Story based games like
                        Assasin's Creed franchise, I am into almost every AAA games as long as they provide satisfying graphics
                        a vast fantasy world whether it's set in past or future. Some of my favorite games would be <br />
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><b>Assasin's Creed Blackflag</b>

                            </li>
                            <li><b>Cyber Punk 2077</b>

                            </li>
                            <li><b>Hogwarts Legacy</b>

                </li>
                <li><h3>Card Magic</h3>
                    <img src="" height="200">
                    <p>Did you know although there are only 52 cards in a standard deck, the number of their shuffle order
                        is astronomically large being 52! which is around 8.0658x10^67. Whether it's about sleight of hand 
                        or simply some math tricks, I can't get enough of the beloved reactions I get showing people what 
                        little magic I have mastered
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From short poems to long novels, I am always down for a good read. My favorite genre would be 
                        adventure, fantasy, scifi or all of them. Pages capture me like spells cast by an old wizard 
                        with ancient wizdom. Three of my favorite books are
